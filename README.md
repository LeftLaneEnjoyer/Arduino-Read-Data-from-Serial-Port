SET UP:
1. Upload the INO file to your Arduino, in this case we use a temperature module (DHT11). Make sure that you edit line 20, if you use another module. The DHT11 can read the temperatur and the humidity
2. Setup XAMPP and start MySQl + create 2 tables named: "data" and "luft"
3. go in my_sql_connectio and eddit your data (Line 20-21 and 34-35) 
4. start the main.py and select your port! It's usually 3
5. if there is a permission error, make sure that you closed the Arduino IDE
